## Useful Methodologies
### Stage 1
#### SIFT Feature Extractor
Useful for finding feature correspondences between images. This feature correspondence can then be used by SfM to reconstruct 3D geometry.
Variant: 128-byte SIFT descriptor
#### Image Descriptors
#### Visual Features
#### Bag-of-words technique
Useful for retrieving similar images.
#### SfM (Structure from Motion) technique
Useful for 3D reconstruction.
#### Epitomes
#### Clustering
Useful to derive specific images(/specific data) from a large collection of images(/data).
#### GIST Descriptor
Useful for retrieving similar images.
#### Image matching
Useful for 3D reconstruction.
#### Vocabulary tree
Used for proposing initial set of matchcing images for SIFT Feature Extractor.
#### Greedy Algorithm
This algorithm always selects the most valuable dataset or state.
